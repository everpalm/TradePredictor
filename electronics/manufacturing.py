    Electronics manufacturing service stock predictor.

    This class implements the BasePredictor interface to provide
    specialized prediction functionality for electronics manufacturing
    service stocks. It focuses on analyzing and forecasting trends
    specific to electronics manufacturing services companies.

    Factory class for creating Service predictor instances.

    This factory creates appropriate Service predictor objects
    based on stock code and other parameters. Currently supports
    only stock code '2317'.

    Inherits from BasePredictorFactory to maintain a consistent
    factory pattern implementation across the system.

        Create and return an appropriate service predictor instance.

        Based on the stock code configured in the factory, this method
        returns the appropriate predictor implementation. Currently

        Parameters
        ----------
        **kwargs : dict
            Keyword arguments to pass to the predictor constructor.

        -------
        BasePredictor
            An instance of a class implementing the BasePredictor interface.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the requested stock code is not supported by this factory.
