    Integrated predictor for stock market forecasting.

    This class implements the BasePredictor interface to provide
    integrated prediction functionality for specific stock codes.
    It combines multiple prediction techniques to generate more
    accurate forecasts of stock market behavior.

    Inherits from BasePredictor to maintain a consistent interface

    Factory class for creating Integrated predictor instances.

    This factory creates appropriate Integrated predictor objects
    based on stock code and other parameters. Currently supports
    only stock code '2002'.

    Inherits from BasePredictorFactory to maintain a consistent
    factory pattern implementation across the system.

        Create and return an appropriate predictor instance.

        Based on the stock code configured in the factory, this method

        Parameters
        ----------
        **kwargs : dict

        BasePredictor
            An instance of a class implementing the BasePredictor interface.

        ------
        ValueError
